# DiscordAutoReactBot

This bot automatically reacts to user's messages with their favorite emoji on Discord.

__WARNING:__ AutoReact is in early development, and is only updated when @DaniSprague has time. A lot of functionality is missing, including the ability to save user preferences across restarts of the bot, such that one should not consider AutoReact to be at v0.1 yet. Use this at your own risk!

## Usage

AutoReact supports several commands. To use any of these commands, users should direct message the bot on Discord with any of the following:

| __Prefix__ | __Command__ | __Arguments__ | __Functionality__ | __Example__ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| !AutoReact | help | *none* | Messages the user with help info | `!AutoReact help`
| !AutoReact | set | emoji | Sets the users reaction emoji | `!AutoReact set ðŸ¤”` |

## Functionality

Once the user sets their preferred emoji using `!AutoReact set`, then AutoReact will react to that user's messages with the set emoji in servers where AutoReact is enabled. Currently, there is no cooldown on reactions, so this has the chance to appear as spam if the user sends a lot of messages.

## Installation

In order to get AutoReact running on your local machine, the following steps should work:

1. Pull this repository onto a local machine.
2. Create the `.env` file with the private key info.
    * The `.env` file should be in the same directory as `bot.py`.
    * The format of `.env` should be two lines as follows:

    ```none
    DISCORD_TOKEN=[PRIVATE_TOKEN]

    ```

    * The private token can be found on the Discord Developer Portal

3. Install [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [`python-dotenv`](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/) using a Python package manager.
4. Run `bot.py` from a command line.

[This article](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) provides additional details on handling the Discord Developer Portal to get the bot running on a local installation. It also covers how to add the bot to a Discord server.

There are plans to provide both a Docker Image and the ability to load the bot on one's own server from a hosted installation, but those are not yet ready.

## Roadmap

This project is still quite lacking. One goal is to get the Wiki up and running for a more formal roadmap. Until then, [the Milestones portion of the Issues tab](https://github.com/DaniSprague/DiscordAutoReactBot/milestones) should give a good idea of what is needed for each version.

## Why?

This project sprung out of the COVID-19 pandemic when @DaniSprague desired something to work on. Checking their list of ideas, they saw an auto-reacting Discord bot listed. They thought it would be a most excellent idea as it would improve their Python skills and help them learn how to work with APIs (even if it was entirely wrapped in a Python package).

As to why the project idea came into existence in the first place, there was a joke about emojis and wholesomeness in a Discord chat. It is not a very deep story.

## Thanks

This project would have been infinitely more difficult without [realpython.com's wonderful tutorial on making a Discord bot in Python](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/). The basic template code came from there.

Additionally, shout-out to the maintainers and authors of all of the Python packages used in this project.
